# Accessible hills

This repository is designed to be a place to keep notes on potential means of getting to hills throughout the UK without the use of a car.
It's designed to be a slightly more up to date of works such as [this](http://www.steverabone.com/MunroWalker/munros_by_public_transport.htm) and [this](https://www.stevenfallon.co.uk/munros-by-train.html), but with some added flexibility.
As a result some of the routes are likely to require additional walking distance, cycling, or completing a longer round of hills than descriptions on [walkhighlands](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/) would normally suggest.
